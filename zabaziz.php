            <p>
                My name is Zubair Aziz. I am 21 years old. I was born on April 28, 1996. My hometown is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I am currently a junior, anticipated to graduate in May, 2019. I started off my first year in college majoring in Economics.
                I had the privilege to enroll in some interesting courses in the department, such as Sports Economics, where
                we tested out various economic theories in a sports setting, and Econometrics where students are taught how
                to use the tools that enable us to extract useful information about important economic policy from a set
                of available data.
            </p>   

            <p>I also decided to major in Computer Science after taking a few computer
                science courses that seemed interesting to me. Because of this, towards the end of my college “career”, I’m
                taking mostly CS courses. However, this semester in particular will be very interesting as I’m also enrolled
                in a dance class and an art class. I'm excited for this chance to branch out and obtain new experiences before
                I graduate.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
<div class="one">
            <p>
                I currently work for IT Services on campus, working as an IT Consultant. Here, I assist with network registration and troubleshoot
                network issues, troubleshoot NetID and login issues, provide support through various methods,assist with
                various types of malware on students' personal computers. I’d say that the most interesting experience while
                working here are the night-owl shifts, where I work at the help desk, doing the exact same thing an IT Consultant
                would normally do, except at the late hours of midnight to 8 am.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other than that, last summer I had the chance to work for Media Prima Digital, a multimedia company based in
                Malaysia. There, I was an intern working as a developer that worked on web & app development. Here, I worked
                with the team to develop modern websites and apps for various different uses. I was also trained in both
                front end and back end systems for web development. I learned how to optimize pages for better load speeds
                and better rankings for search engine optimization. One of the more notable projects we had was working with
                Robot Framework, a Python extension, to automate web page testing. All the while doing all this, I also learned
                how to apply agile software development techniques in a dev team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm involved in some extra-curricular activities such as Alpha Kappa Psi, the professional business fraternity; and Grass
                Roots Soccer, a health organization that uses the power of soccer to educate, inspire, and mobilize young
                people to lead healthier lives. These two organizations have helped me develop so much as a student, where
                Alpha Kappa Psi has helped me develop my professional skills tremendously, and Grass Roots Soccer has given
                me a great opportunity to give back to the community.

            <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
<div class="two">
            <p>
                I enjoy painting in my free time. I took up painting a few years ago, teaching myself different painting techniques on various
                mediums. I mostly do nature scenes and landscapes. Attempting these types of paintings tend to help relax
                and find solace in the quiet and solidarity I find while painting.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, when I’m looking for a change of pace, I usually go play basketball. It’s one of the few sports that I find very
                enjoyable, not just to watch, but also play. I started playing basketball in middle school, and have enjoyed
                playing it ever since.
