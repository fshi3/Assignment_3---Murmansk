		<p>
			My name is Kyle Pollock. I am a Computer Science student of Class '18. I am also minoring in Chinese Language and Culture.
			I began my undergraduate career at the University of Rochester studying genetics with a focus in premedical studies. The
			second semester of my freshman year, I went out on a limb and took CSC171 (Introduction to Java). I knew that the class
			would be difficult, especially since I had absolutely zero experience in programming, but it ended up being the best choice
			I made in college! Starting my sophomore year, I switched to a computer science major and have not looked back since!
			I dived into the major, taking as many courses as I could possibly take in a given semester in order to keep up with the
			other students in my class and graduate on time. To this day, I am so glad that I ended up switching majors and my career
			trajectory. Ever since I wrote my first “Hello, World!” program, I have been completely sold on computer science as both
			a career, pastime, and continuous education.

		<h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
		<div class="two">
		<p>
			I’m a total nerd. And, like most nerds, I played a lot of video games as a kid. I eventually got bored of playing the same
			games, so I started to modify the code behind my games: adding to them, perfecting them. I didn't know it then, but that
			was just the start of my love of programming. I moved on from just coding video games to learning multiple programming
			languages and coding more and more, both in the classroom and beyond. Most recently, I have been applying my knowledge
			of object oriented programming and MVC design pattern to create mobile applications, both natively with Android Studio
			and Xcode, as well as hybridized with Angular and the Ionic framework. It is so exciting to see everything I have learned
			come together in the form of functioning applications! I love talking about anything new and exciting in research or technology.
			Please feel free to send me a message here on LinkedIn or my University of Rochester email: kpolloc3@u.rochester.edu Specialties:
			Web and mobile application development, market research, statistics, and financial accounting and investment.
